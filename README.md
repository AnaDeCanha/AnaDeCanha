## 💕 About Me

Currently based in London, I’m a UX Engineer specializing in building interactive, accessible, and user-friendly digital experiences using technologies like React, TypeScript, and Next.js. My background in frontend development and love for design thinking allow me to craft solutions that are both functional and delightful.

I’ve worked on exciting projects, from developing a scheduling module for an advertising platform to collaborating with design teams to bring beautiful, user-focused interfaces to life.

When I’m not designing or coding, you’ll probably find me learning languages, optimizing workflows, or writing about my adventures in my newsletter. ☕📚✨
And if I’m not doing that... I’m probably exploring new places! ✈️💕
