## 🚀 About Me

Currently based in London, I’m a Freelance Frontend Developer specializing in creating responsive, accessible, and engaging web solutions using technologies like React, TypeScript, and Next.js. My journey in tech has been complemented by a deep interest in product design, which helps me build not just functional but delightful experiences.

I’ve worked on exciting projects, including developing a scheduling module for an advertising platform and collaborating with design agencies to create beautiful, functional web designs.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring coffee shops, reading, or writing about my adventures. ☕📚 If I'm not traveling, of course ✈️💕
