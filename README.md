# 💬 Hi, I'm Ana De Canha!

¡Hola! Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Frontend Developer transitioning into UX Engineering, passionate about creating interactive, accessible digital experiences. I combine technical development skills with user experience thinking to build solutions that work beautifully for both users and developers.

## 💕 About Me

Currently based in London, I'm a Frontend Developer with 4+ years of experience specializing in React, TypeScript, and Next.js. I'm expanding into UX strategy and user research to become a full-stack UX Engineer who can take projects from user insights through to polished implementation.

My background includes building scalable frontend features, collaborating closely with design teams, and applying accessibility best practices (WCAG standards) to ensure inclusive experiences for all users.

I love solving real user problems through code and design - whether that's optimizing a conversion flow, building accessible components, or creating design systems that scale.

When I'm not coding or wireframing, you'll find me learning languages, exploring UX methodologies, or sharing what I learn through my content. ☕📚✨
