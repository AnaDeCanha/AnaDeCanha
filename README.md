# Hi, I'm Ana De Canha

UX Engineer bridging UX thinking and frontend development to build accessible, production-ready product interfaces.

## About Me

I work end-to-end across UX and frontend — from user research and flow definition to building the interfaces that bring them to life in React and Next.js.

I specialise in UX audits, friction analysis, and user flow design, with accessibility (WCAG) built into everything I do. I'm currently building Refella, an early-stage product of my own, where I own the full UX and frontend execution.

I work best in small, product-led teams where UX decisions and frontend implementation happen close together.

When I'm not building, you'll find me learning languages, exploring UX methodologies, or sharing what I learn through UX Pals. ☕
